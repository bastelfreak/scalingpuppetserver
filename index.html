some explanation: bastelfreak noticed in the Archlinux community that people are happy, if you send them sweets

We tried this in the Puppet community as well. Puppet Inc. received 15pounds of sweets for all their encouragement for the community.

You all keep contributing and bastelfreak will send you sweets as well!
